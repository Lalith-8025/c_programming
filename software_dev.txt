## Software Development - Software Development is the process of designing, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications. 



## 1 front end -   HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Defines the structure of web content.
Example: headings, paragraphs, images.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Styles the appearance of the web page (colors, fonts, layouts).

Adds interactivity to web pages (e.g., animations, form validation).


Frameworks and Libraries:
React.js (JavaScript library for building UIs).
Angular (Google's TypeScript-based web framework).



2 middleware - express js , Python ( Flask, FastAPI, Django) , Java , Ruby , C# ( .NET Core ) , PHP

3 backend -  Python (Django, Flask.) , C# (ASP.NET.) , Java



## software development

web app - designed for specific user interactions.

website - collection of interlinked webpages

webpage -  a single document or page on the internet that is identified by a unique URL.


API - An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other


## CRUD = Create Read Update Delete


## AGILE methodology - research analysis , design , testing the software for the client and having structured procedure or principles

## Testing - unit testing , integration testing


## Compiler -  checks entire code for error
     interpreter - checks each n every single line for error

##  (1)   Procedural language- C (top down approach)
      (2)  Object oriented - C++ (top down approach) , Java(bottom-up)
      (3)  functional - haskell 
      (4)  scripting language - python , js

Types of Program paradigms:

i) imperative programming ( step by step procedure - steps are given without the solution )

ii)  declarative  programming ( what the program accomplish - solution is presented without the steps )

iii) object oriented  programming (obj that represent real world entities - encapsulation = state of obj manipulated by methods, inheritance, polymorphism)

iv) logical  programming ( solve prob using logical interface)

v) programming
